    <p>This is the best recipe for boneless prime rib I know. Seasoned with a simple garlic and herb rub, it cooks in about 90 minutes and the meat comes out oh so tender.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) boneless prime rib roast</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>3 teaspoons salt</li>

        <li>3 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Place prime rib in a roasting pan, fat-side up. </li>

        <li>Blend olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary together in a food processor. Pour over the roast. Let sit at room temperature, about 15 minutes.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Cook until medium-rare or an instant-read thermometer reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 60 to 75 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
